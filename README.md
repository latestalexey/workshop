Kotlin workshop

Hello!
- There are several tasks for you to taste the Kotlin language.
- Each task is located in its folder, e.g. src/task0/task0.kt.
- There are tests for each task (Choose 'Run' -> 'Run...' in menu,
and invoke appropriate test configuration, 'testAll' for all tests).
- The global goal is to fix all tests (make 'testAll' green).
- In most cases you have to replace the following (comment & exception) with meaningful code:
          // your code goes here
          throw UnsupportedOperationException()
NB: In Kotlin there is no 'new' operator, so you just invoke constructor without it (as usual function).
